# `@appsignal/ember`

- [Documentation][docs]

The `@appsignal/javascript` integration for Ember v3.11+.

See also the [mono repo README](../../README.md) for more information.

## Installation

Add the  `@appsignal/ember` and `@appsignal/javascript` packages to your `package.json`. Then, run `yarn install`/`npm install`.

You can also add these packages to your `package.json` on the command line:

```
yarn add @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/ember
npm install --save @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/ember
```

With the `ember-cli` tool, packages from `npm` cannot be imported into your application by default. You will need to add some kind of method for loading external modules. We recommend using [`ember-auto-import`](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import), which requires little to no configuration to setup. 

Install the following using `ember-cli`:

```
ember install ember-auto-import
```

[A number of other methods and custom configurations are available](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/addons-and-dependencies/) for importing this library in a way that suits your app.

## Usage

### `Ember.onerror`/`Ember.RSVP.on("error")`

The default Ember integration is a function that binds to the `Ember.onerror` and `Ember.RSVP.on("error")` handlers. In a new app created using `ember-cli`, your `app.js` file might include something like this:

```js
import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript"
import { installErrorHandler } from "@appsignal/ember"

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY"
})

installErrorHandler(appsignal)
```

The integration will look for `window.Ember` to bind to by default. You can also pass the `Ember` instance as the optional second parameter to `installErrorHandler`, e.g. `installErrorHandler(appsignal, Ember)`.

## Development

### Installation

Make sure mono is installed and bootstrapped, see the [project README's development section](../../README.md#dev-install) for more information.

You can then run the following to start the compiler in _watch_ mode. This automatically compiles both the ES Module and CommonJS variants:

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

You can also build the library without watching the directory:

```
yarn build        # build both CJS and ESM
yarn build:cjs    # just CJS
yarn build:esm    # just ESM
```

### Testing

The tests for this library use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the following command in the root of this repository to run the tests for all packages, or in the directory of a package to run only the tests pertaining to that package:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Versioning

This repo uses [Semantic Versioning][semver] (often referred to as _semver_). Each package in the repository is versioned independently from one another.

@TODO: define how this works once we know more about releasing
